        <p class="intro"> <strong>I am a cloud engineer and I am comfortable working with cloud service providers' platforms such as AWS, Azure, GCP and Linode. At other times, when I am not cloud computing, I build websites such as this one ðŸ˜Š. Sports is my thing and my favorite amongst them is tennis. Saturday mornings are for playing tennis. </strong></p>

          <h3>Cloud Engineering</h3>
          <p class="skill-description1"><strong>I started out as a cloud support engineer because I wanted to ensure that customers realize the value offered in cloud products and services. Then, I became fascinated by the several cloud technologies such as terraform, kubernetes, ansible, jerkins, docker etcetra and how they make migration and deployment to the cloud a seemless process which led to my interest and growth to become a DevOps Engineer. I have gained a wealth of experience in designing and implementing cloud solutions.I look forward to a lifetime journey of building and deploying in the cloud.</strong>

          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p class="skill-description2"><strong>Web development was and is still my first love in the world of technology. After several trials and errors in acquiring the skills, I can now humbly call myself a fullstack web developer. Designing, Developing and Seeing a website come-to-life(becoming fully functional) gives me an unspeakable joy. Actually, it makes me feel like I have some super power and nobody can take it away from me.</strong> </p>
